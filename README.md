~ADT based graphics designing program~

overview:
This program is designed to allow the user to create very basic graphics designs, using integer based numbers which are associated with a color the user will then use the paint/erase functions to color the desired design onto a matrix which will save and reprint it as a .md file

program loop:
system generates a blank screen, and then prompts the user for a set of three numbers;

the 1st number is the _X coordinate,
the 2nd number is the _Y coordinate,
the 3rd number is the _color of the space which the _X and _Y coordinates point to

the screen function will then reprint the screen with the new colored space
	
the main function will then ask for another set of numbers

this will repeat until the user decides to save their progress or save and exit the program, this also allows for the user to make designs
